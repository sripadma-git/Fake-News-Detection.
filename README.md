# Fake-News-Detection.

📰 Fake News Detection

🔍 Overview

Fake news has become a significant problem in today's digital age. This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify news articles as real or fake. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we analyze the text of news articles to determine their authenticity.

✨ Features

📝 Preprocessing of textual data using NLP techniques

🤖 Implementation of various machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, etc.)

🔠 Feature extraction using TF-IDF and Count Vectorization

📊 Model evaluation and accuracy comparison

🌐 Deployment of the trained model using Flask

📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Fake News" dataset, which contains labeled real and fake news articles. It can be found at: Kaggle Fake News Dataset

🛠 Technologies Used

🐍 Python

📚 Scikit-learn

🏗 Pandas & NumPy

✂ NLTK & spaCy

🌍 Flask (for deployment)

📓 Jupyter Notebook
⚙ Usage

🏋 Train the model using train.py

🔎 Test the model on new articles using predict.py

🚀 Deploy the model using Flask by running app.py
